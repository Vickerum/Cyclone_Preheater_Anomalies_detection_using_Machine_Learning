# Cyclone_Preheater_Anomalies_detection_using_Machine_Learning
This project focuses on developing an anomaly detection system for the cyclone preheater in an industrial setting. The goal is to detect abnormal behavior or malfunctions in the preheater system, which can help in improving efficiency, preventing failures, and reducing downtime.

# Project Overview
Objective: Build a machine learning-based anomaly detection system for the cyclone preheater.

Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset collected from sensors and monitoring devices installed in the cyclone preheater. The dataset includes various operational parameters and measurements.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering to extract meaningful information.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the distribution of data, identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the preheater system.

Feature Selection: Select relevant features that are most informative for detecting anomalies.
